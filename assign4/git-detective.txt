I first entered git log | grep "In read-only repositories" to find the commit IDs of relevant changes that contained these key words however these took me to the merge commits. I found the original changes using git log --grep="read-only repositories" --no-merges, which filtered out merge commits and resulted in the commitID which included ID: 0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc. This changes was authorized by Johannes Schindelin on September 28 2022. I then ran git format-patch -1  0b55d930a69692c7f4e7b90e35fa41f6c46df4bc to generate the patch files. Resulted in 0001-merge-ort-fix-segmentation-fault-in-read-only-reposi.patch.
